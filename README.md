# Wordle Clone

This is a website with a collection of some of my more liked games while experimenting with Vite and TypeScript.

## Tech Stack

*   **[React](https://react.dev/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
*   **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)**: For routing and navigation within the application.
*   **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: For code linting and maintaining code quality.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wordle.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd wordle
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in the development mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing.
